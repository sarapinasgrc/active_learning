## TSVM Model

The file [`TSVM.py`] was taken and modified from the repository [LAMDA-SSL](https://github.com/YGZWQZD/LAMDA-SSL), developed by [@YGZWQZD](https://github.com/YGZWQZD).

Original repository: [https://github.com/YGZWQZD/LAMDA-SSL](https://github.com/YGZWQZD/LAMDA-SSL)  

> Some parts of the code have been modified to fit the requirements of this project.

## 📊 Implemented Methods  

### Initial Selection Methods 🎯
- **Minimum Distance**: Selects samples by maximizing the minimum distance between labeled and unlabeled samples.  
- **Mean Distance**: Selects samples by maximizing the mean distance between labeled and unlabeled samples.

### Active Learning Strategies 🔍
- **Coreset**: Selects the most representative samples by entropy + euclidean distance.  
- **Entropy**: Selects samples with the highest uncertainty, calculated by entropy.  
- **Uncertainty Distance**: Combines least uncertainty and euclidean distance.
- **Variance**: Selects samples with highest variance (intended for GP Classifiers).
- **Least Confidence**: Selects samples the model is the least confidence in its prediction.
- **Margin Sampling**: Selects samples with lowest difference between probabilities of being in the two most probable classes.
- **Support Vector**: Selects samples that are used as a support vector in the creation of the decision boundary and are NOT LABELED, if no unlabeled samples as SVs, then coreset method (Intended ONLY for TSVM and Multiclass TSVM). 

### Implemented Models 🧠  
- **Transductive SVM (TSVM) and Multiclass TSVM**, for binary and multiclass classification 
- **Standard SVM**
- **Gaussian Process Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression Classifier**
- **Random Forest**
